#summary Description of free Magento AMI on Amazon
= Introduction =

We created a free AMI with Magento pre-installed. The AMI has additional tools and apps to help manage the instance. We expect the user to be the average site owner, not a sys-admin, so the process of configuration was made as user friendly as possible. You may still need help of a qualified system administrator to complete some of the tasks.
