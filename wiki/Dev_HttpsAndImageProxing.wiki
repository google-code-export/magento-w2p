= Introduction =

ZetaPrints serves different types of images: 
  * previews
  * thumbnails for previews
  * stock images
  * stock image thumbnails 
  * user images
  * user images thumbnails

Web-to-print images are added to Magento pages as direct links to ZetaPrints.
Web browsers produce a warning about unsecure content if a Magento page was opened via _HTTPS_. Our extension proxies this content through Magento to remove HTTP components from the page. Also it proxies all HTTP caching headers for images from ZetaPrints.
Images are proxied in memory only and are never cached on the disk.

= Details =

== Links to controllers ==
Links to web-to-print specific controllers are generated by `getUrl()` function from _[http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/trunk/app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/Helper/Data.php app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/Helper/Data.php]_ file. This function checks scheme in request object to decide which scheme to use.

== Links to images ==
Links to different web-to-print images are generated by functions specific for each type of image. Functions check scheme in request object and return link to controllers for proxing images then scheme is _HTTPS_ or direct link to ZetaPrints in case plain _HTTP_. See _get_preview_url()_, _get_thumbnail_url()_, _get_photo_thumbnail_url()_ functions from _[http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/trunk/app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/Helper/Data.php app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/Helper/Data.php]_ file.

== User images uploading ==
User images are uploaded to a temp folder in Magento first. It can be done over HTTP or HTTPS. After this, ZetaPrints downloads the images over HTTP, always.
